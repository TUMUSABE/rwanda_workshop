# Schedule

## Day 0: Preparing for the Workshop
Participants are expected to have basic fluency in `python` or another high-level programming language. You can familiarize yourself with `python` by completing online tutorials, for example: https://www.learnpython.org

For this course, we will be using [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com) - a free cloud computing service that comes with pre-installed machine learning tools. Colab is built on Jupyter Notebooks, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. You can familiarize yourself with the interface of Colab (and Jupyter) notebooks by reading the following tutorials (remember you don't need to install anything!):

1. [A Beginner’s Tutorial to Jupyter Notebooks](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-tutorial-to-jupyter-notebooks-1b2f8705888a)
2. [Introduction to Colab and Python](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l01c01_introduction_to_colab_and_python.ipynb)

**Day 0 Homework:** 
Please fill out the [participant survey](https://forms.gle/17V861mp1grWJ5dC6) before the end of Day 1.

## Day 1 (July 8th): Exploring Data and Building Regression Models
In Day 1,  we will cover how to read data from file, deal with different types and address different issues with data. We will see how to generate and test simple hypotheses from basic data visualizations and summaries. At the end of Day 1, we will see how to build machine models for predicting a continuous output.

The dataset we will be using is the [Berlin Airbnb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/brittabettendorf/berlin-airbnb-data) 

For exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will be using three `python` libraries: `matplotlib` for visualization, `pandas` for data manipulation, `numpy` for operations with numerical data. You can familiarize yourself with these three important libraries by reading the following online tutorials:
1. [Matplotlib Tutorial: Learn basics of Python’s powerful Plotting library](https://towardsdatascience.com/matplotlib-tutorial-learn-basics-of-pythons-powerful-plotting-library-b5d1b8f67596)
2. [Numpy Tutorial Part 1 – Introduction to Arrays](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/numpy-tutorial-part1-array-python-examples/)
3. [Pandas Tutorial 1: Pandas Basics (Reading Data Files, DataFrames, Data Selection](https://data36.com/pandas-tutorial-1-basics-reading-data-files-dataframes-data-selection/)

**Day 1 Materials:** 
1. Slides: [EDA](https://github.com/onefishy/rwanda_workshop/blob/master/lectures/lecture_1/Day_1_Lecture_Notes_EDA.ipynb), [Regression](https://github.com/onefishy/rwanda_workshop/blob/master/lectures/lecture_1/Day_1_Lecture_Notes_Regression.ipynb)
2. Readings: [Intro to Python I](https://github.com/onefishy/rwanda_workshop/blob/master/lectures/lecture_1/Intro_to_Python.pdf), [Intro to Python II](https://github.com/onefishy/rwanda_workshop/blob/master/lectures/lecture_1/Intro_to_Python_II.pdf), [Python Cheetsheet](https://github.com/onefishy/rwanda_workshop/blob/master/lectures/lecture_1/Python_cheatsheet.pdf)
3. Exercises: [Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12aYMVK9W3spq7HEZ_881Z5-InDwZK3lm)

**Day 1 Homework:** 
Complete the Day 1 colab notebooks.

## Day 2 (July 9th): Models for Classification
In Day 2, we will cover different machine learning models for classification. We also discuss how to evaluate and interpret models. 

The dataset we will be using is the [The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Data](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/historic-data/?geo=ca&records=all-records&field_descriptions=labels), which consists of US mortgage loan applications and outcomes.

**Day 2 Materials:** 
1. [Slides]
2. [Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z77pNtlN6EyhNMc8KA5EgfBsj8x293Qv)

**Day 2 Homework:** 
Complete the Day 2 colab notebooks.

## Day 3 (July 10th): Models for Image Analysis

In Day 3, we will introduce neural networks models for both regression and classification. We will focus especially on using neural networks for image analysis tasks. 

The dataset we will be using is the [Sentinel-2 satellite images dataset](http://madm.dfki.de/downloads).

**Day 3 Materials:** 
1. [Slides]
2. [Colab Notebooks]

**Day 3 Homework:** 
Complete the Day 3 colab notebooks.

## Day 4 (July 11th): Models for Natural Language Processing

In Day 4, we will discuss how to process and represent text data and we will focus on using neural networks for natural language processing tasks. 

The dataset we will be using is the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

**Day 4 Materials:** 
1. [Slides]
2. [Colab Notebooks]

**Day 3 Homework:** 
Complete the Day 4 colab notebooks.


## Day 5 (July 12th): Final Exam
The course culminates in a 4-hour in class coding exam, where each participant will apply data science concepts and tools to a real data solving a real task. The exam is open book/notes - participants may use any class material. Exams need to be completed in colab and shared with the instructor for grading. **Late exams and alternate forms of submissions** will not be accepted.

The tasks on the exam will be similar to those in the class colab notebooks - completing the notebooks from class is crucial for success on the exam!
